/// Example of a custom goods widget
///
/// This class is inherited from `CustomGoodsView` in order to be able to receive and pass this within the SDK.
///
/// - Note: When using a fully custom product widget, the SDK knows nothing about what's going on inside
/// the widget, for the widget to interact with the SDK, you need to call these methods in overridden methods of the superclass.
///
/// Since this implementation of the custom goods widget does not use the `getGoodsObject` closure to get
/// the goods objects, it is necessary to use its own format for the goods objects, as well as to get and create them
/// in the ``setSKUItems(_:)`` method. At the time of receiving and processing the data, you can display the preloader.
///
/// After the user has tapped on the item, it is necessary to call the method `super.goodsItemClick(with sku: String)`
/// in order for SDK to collect data for statistics about the selected item, otherwise, the statistics displayed in the console will be incorrect.
///
/// For correct operation of the reader, from which this widget was opened, if you need to close the widget,
/// you need to call the method `super.close()`. This will let the reader know that the widget is closed and
/// it can resume playing the story logic inside itself.
///
