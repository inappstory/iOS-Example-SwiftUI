/// An example implementation of a simple cell with a full cell area cover.
///
/// It is necessary that the cell class inherits from `UICollectionViewCell` and implements the `StoryCellProtocol` protocol
///
/// The example shows how to create a cell with an *.xib* file. In order to use programmatic cell layout it is necessary to return the value `nil` in the variable ``nib``
/// ```
/// static var nib: UINib? { return nil }
/// ```
///
/// Appearance parameters are configured in the cell itself in the ``awakeFromNib()`` method, such as colors, rounding, and fonts.
/// The `StoryView` list knows nothing about the internal state of the cell and can only affect it by calling `StoryCellProtocol` methods.
/// - Remark: To display the cell contents correctly, remember to clear the fields in the method ``prepareForReuse()``
///
/// # Video cover
/// Due to the peculiarities of the audio playback system, installing video cover may affect the playback
/// of music from a player application running in the background, even if there is no sound in the video.
/// In order to keep the sound from background playback, it is necessary to set a certain category for `AVAudioSession`,
/// but it is difficult to do it in `AVPlayer`. If your application does not contain video playback functions or sounds
/// that should mute background music playback, you can use the example and set the category for `AVAudioSession` as `.ambient`.
/// This way, background music will not be muted if the covers contain videos.
/// ```
/// do {
///     try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setCategory(.ambient)
///     try AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().setActive(true)
/// } catch let error as NSError {
///     print(error)
/// }
/// ```
/// If an application contains video or music that should override background playback, you can set a different category before playing it to `AVAudioSession`
